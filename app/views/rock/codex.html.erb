      We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.

      That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.

      Across the sea of space, the stars are other suns.

      As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.

      It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn't feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.    </div>

      If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon.

      That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.

      Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind.

      There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.

      To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.

      A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.

      Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind.

      The path of a cosmonaut is not an easy, triumphant march to glory. You have to get to know the meaning not just of joy but also of grief, before being allowed in the spacecraft cabin.
